# Alternative Fuel
This plugin was developed for my private SMP server with friends. The concept of this plugin is to add a new fuel source type which is better than current fuel sources.

## Peat
Peat is a new fuel source which is better than coal and charcoal. Peat Shards can be crafted using compostable materials such as seeds and leaves ([full list]()) which then can be crafted into Peat Blocks, which is the desired fuel source.

## Material List
### Seeds
* `Beetroot Seeds`
* `Melon Seeds`
* `Pumpkin Seeds`
* `Wheat Seeds`
### Leaves
* `Oak Leaves`
* `Spruce Leaves`
* `Birch Leaves`
* `Jungle Leaves`
* `Acacia Leaves`
* `Cherry Leaves`
* `Dark Oak Leaves`
* `Mangrove Leaves`
* `Azalea Leaves`
* `Flowering Azalea Leaves`

## Crafting Peat Shards
You can craft Peat Shards using one of the materials on the material list in a 3x3 crafting grid.
